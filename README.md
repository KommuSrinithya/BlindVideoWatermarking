# BlindVideoWatermarking
Video watermarking is a technique used to embed hidden information (watermark) into a video signal in such a way that it remains perceptually invisible but can be reliably extracted later. In this project, we implement video watermarking using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a widely used technique for image and video processing.
